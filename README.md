# Vectorization
Implementation of vectorization with an example 

Vectorization is used to speed up the Python code without using loop. Using such a function can help in minimizing the running time of code efficiently. Various operations are being performed over vector such as dot product of vectors which is also known as scalar product as it produces single output, outer products which results in square matrix of dimension equal to length X length of the vectors, Element wise multiplication which products the element of same indexes and dimension of the matrix remain unchanged.
