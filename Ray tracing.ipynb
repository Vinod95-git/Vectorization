    "The goal of this worksheet is for you to write a simple raytracer. That is, a program that takes a 3D model and generates an image of what it looks like from a particular camera angle (this is called _rendering_). In this case the 3D model will be represented by a _signed distance function_, which makes rendering particularly easy.\n"

    "## Raytracing with Ray Marching\n",
    "\n",
    "Real light gets emitted from a light source and then bounces from surface to surface around the world. Some of it may hit a camera, where it is absorbed and generates an electrical current, which is interpreted as an image. For instance, a ray of light may be emitted from the sun, hurtle across the vacume for 8 minutes and 19 seconds before descending through the atmosphere to strike a kitten on the head. The light then bounces off the kittens hair and into a camera, just so you can waste your time looking at cute cat images on the internet (Note: It's actually far more complicated than this. For one thing most 'bounces' are actually the light being absorbed then emitted again.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Raytracing simulates this, but backwards for efficiency. We don't care about rays that never strike the camera. For the purpose of this exercise we are only going to simulate a single step. Our output image is a 2D grid of pixels. For each pixel a ray is fired out towards the scene. It will either miss all of the geometry and fly towards infinity, or it will strike the surface of an object. We can then measure the length of the ray and output a _depth map_, an image colour coded with the depth of each pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each ray is represented by three pieces of information:\n",
    " * It's starting location, a coordinate (length 3 vector). In effect, the location of the pixel on the sensor inside the virtual camera.\n",
    " * It's direction of travel, a normal, that is a length 3 vector with unit length.\n",
    " * How far it has travelled, a scalar.\n",
    " \n",
    "This means we can work out where the end of the ray is as\n",
    "\n",
    "`end = start + travel * normal`\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenge of raytracing is _collision detection_, that is detecting how far a ray can travel before it collides with a surface. Computer games mostly cheat, for speed; rendering for film vfx uses ray/triangle interactions with dense 3D geometry, combined with complex data structures for speed. We're going to do something completely different, that is most commonly used to optimise collision detection in physics simulations rather than rendering. A __signed distance function__ (sdf) tells you for every location how far you are from a surface. Imagine placing a sphere at the end of a ray and making it as large as possible before it touches the surface of an object. Its radius is the distance returned by the _sdf_ at the end of the ray. The distance is positive if you're outside an object, but negated if you're inside an object; the surface of an object in a _sdf_ is hence the _isosurface_ or _level set_ with value zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "To collide a ray with a _sdf_ you repeat a simple process: evaluate the sdf at the current end point of the ray then move that far. If the ray is fired directly at the surface you will immediately collide, and the next time you evaluate the _sdf_ you will get $0$, and stop moving. Normally rays make glancing blows, and over many iterations get a little closer each time, until they stop moving on the surface of the object. This is the _ray marching algorithm_.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to represent a _sdf_. The _sdf_ for a sphere is entirely analytic for instance - just the distance from the centre minus the radius. In this case we will be using _voxels_, quite simply a 3D array representing space, so indexed with 3D coordinates `[x,y,z]`, where the _sdf_ has been evaluated and stored in every cell. One has been provided on moodle (as a .hdf5 file) for you to download and render.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an alternate explanation: http://jamie-wong.com/2016/07/15/ray-marching-signed-distance-functions/ (There are a couple cool videos showing how far this idea can be pushed, plus a more visual explanation; goes far beyond the below however)"
